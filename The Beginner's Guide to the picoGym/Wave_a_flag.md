## üìú Challenge Description
The **Wave a Flag** challenge focuses on exploring the functionality of a binary file. The objective is to discover the flag by invoking the appropriate help flag (`-h`) of the provided binary file. This task encourages learning how to interact with command-line tools effectively.

### 1. **Download the Binary File:**
   Use the `wget` command to download the binary file from the given URL:
   ```bash
   wget https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/b28b6021d6040b086c2226ebeb913bc2/warm
   ```

### 2. **Verify the Download:**
   Confirm the file has been successfully downloaded:
   ```bash
   ls
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   warm
   ```

### 3. **Grant Execution Permission:**
   Make the binary file executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x warm
   ```

### 4. **Run the Help Command:**
   Execute the binary file with the `-h` flag to reveal the help message and the flag:
   ```bash
   ./warm -h
   ```

### 5. **Retrieve the Flag:**
   Output:
   ```
   Oh, help? I actually don't do much, but I do have this flag here: picoCTF{b1scu1ts_4nd_gr4vy_d6969390}
   ```
