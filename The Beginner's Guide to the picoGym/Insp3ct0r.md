## üìö Introduction

This CTF challenge, **Insp3ct0r**, is part of the **picoCTF Web Exploitation** category. It was created by [zaratec](https://github.com/zaratec) and [danny](https://github.com/danny). In this challenge, you are required to inspect a website and extract the flag hidden in the source code. The challenge provides a great opportunity to practice your web exploitation and inspection skills.

### Challenge Overview

Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection:  
[https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/)

You are provided with a URL. Your task is to inspect the web page and extract the flag hidden in the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Solve

Follow these steps to solve the challenge:

1. **Access the URL**:  
   Open the URL [https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/) in your browser.

2. **Capture the Request/Response**:  
   Use a tool like **Burp Suite** to capture the request and response. The page will display a message:  
   "I used these to make this site: HTML, CSS, JS (JavaScript)". This suggests that the flag is hidden within the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

3. **Inspect the HTML**:  
   Right-click on the page and select "Inspect Element" or "View Page Source". In the comments, you will find the first part of the flag:  
   `<!-- Html is neat. Anyways have 1/3 of the flag: picoCTF{tru3_d3`.

   `/* You need CSS to make pretty pages. Here‚Äôs part 2/3 of the flag: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t */`.
