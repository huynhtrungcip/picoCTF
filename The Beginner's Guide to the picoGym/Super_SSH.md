1. **Initial SSH Attempt:**
   Try connecting using the provided username and port:
   ```bash
   ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net 62349
   ```
   Output:
   ```
   ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net: Permission denied (publickey).
   ```
   This indicates the server requires a password or public key for authentication.

2. **Connect Using Port Specification:**
   Use the `-p` flag to specify the correct port:
   ```bash
   ssh ctf-player@titan.picoctf.net -p 62349
   ```
   Upon connecting, you'll see a prompt about the host's authenticity:
   ```
   Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?
   ```
   Type `yes` to proceed. The server's key will be added to your known hosts.

3. **Enter the Password:**
   When prompted, enter the password provided in the challenge details. After successful authentication, the flag will be displayed:
   ```
   Welcome ctf-player, here's your flag: picoCTF{s3cur3_c0nn3ct10n_65a7a106}
   ```
